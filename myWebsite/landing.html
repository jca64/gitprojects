            Hello, my name is Joe Altvater. I am a first year computer science student 
            at the University of Pittsburgh. I have experience with languages such as 
            Java, C#, HTML, CSS, and Python. I intend on completing an information science
            certificate as I am quite interested in Cyber Security. I like skiing, video games,
            baseball, and hanging out with my friends.
